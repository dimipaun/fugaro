# Website redesign

**Status: plan only; nothing of the redesign is implemented.**

The site itself, however, **is** built: `website/` holds an eleven-route Astro site whose
hermetic gates pass (179 tests, `npm run check`, measured 2026-10-18). The three
documents of the first line of work — [`../README.md`](../README.md) `:3` and `:5`,
[`../reconciliation.md`](../reconciliation.md) `:3`,
[`../implementation-plan.md`](../implementation-plan.md) `:3` — still say the opposite,
in the present tense; correcting them is the first part of this line of work
(reconciliation finding **RF1**).

Owner: **@Dimi**. Date: **2026-10-18**. Source: the brief as given to this line of work,
committed alone in this branch's first commit.

## The documents

| file | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| [spec.md](spec.md) | **The brief, as given to this line of work.** Nothing in this directory edits it: it is the thing the rest answers. It is a one-paragraph condensation of the owner's longer text of 2026-10-18, with the same six items, process and "Done when" list; where the longer text says more (item 2: the current colour "looks good but does not match the logo"; item 4: the page "is currently blocks of text that do not explain much"), nothing here contradicts it |
| [reconciliation.md](reconciliation.md) | What the brief asks for, set against what the built site does — findings `RF1`–`RF26`, each **Wrong**, **Exists**, **Gap**, **Rule** or **Open**; the conflicts with the first line of work's decisions (`D90`–`D109`, notably D104's palette and D105's budget) and Global Constraints 6 and 12, with the CSP and the origins gate, and with the content pipeline's generated-file banner (RF8); the logo's sampled hue, the derived palette and its WCAG contrast over every asserted pair; the measurements of the current site; and decisions `D180`–`D192` |
| [implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md) | Nine ordered, independently mergeable parts (`P1`–`P9`), each with a runnable verification and the **named** test change wherever a budget, a gate or a pinned number moves; plus the live checks (`70a`–`70c`) the brief's "Done when" lines need |
| [current/](current/) | The **"before"** set's README: every route at 1280 and 390, with the measurements. **The images are not committed** (they are 7.8 MiB and regenerable); see below |
| [capture-screenshots.mjs](capture-screenshots.mjs) | The script that takes the screenshots and the measurements. It installs nothing into `website/` and `website/package.json` is untouched by it |
| [sample-logo-hue.py](sample-logo-hue.py) | The script that samples the logo's hue (reconciliation §5.1); Pillow only, prints numbers |

## The screenshots: regenerate them, they are not in the tree

The "before" set was taken on 2026-10-18 and removed from the branch before merge;
`docs/website/redesign/current/*.jpg` and `docs/website/redesign/after/*.jpg` are in the
root `.gitignore`. To make the "before" set again, from the repository root, on the commit
whose site you want to capture:

```sh
(cd website && npm ci && npm run build)
npm install --prefix /tmp/fugaro-pw playwright@1.49.1
/tmp/fugaro-pw/node_modules/.bin/playwright install chromium
PLAYWRIGHT_PREFIX=/tmp/fugaro-pw node docs/website/redesign/capture-screenshots.mjs docs/website/redesign/current
```

It writes 22 JPEGs (eleven routes at 1280 × 900 and 390 × 844) into `current/` and the
measurements to `/tmp/website-screenshots.json` (a second argument changes that path). The
"after" set is the same command with `docs/website/redesign/after` as the argument.

## The decisions

Decisions are allocated by the owner in blocks, and the allocation is recorded in
[`../mobile/README.md`](../mobile/README.md): `D90`–`D109` is the site's first line of work,
`D110`–`D129` mobile, `D130`–`D159` the credentials service, `D160`–`D179` the mobile
functional spec. This line of work's thirteen rows are therefore **`D180`–`D192`**, the first
block above the highest allocation — proposed for the owner's confirmation, listed with
their recommendations in [reconciliation.md](reconciliation.md) §9 and repeated in the pull
request body, because a decision taken silently in this branch would be the one kind of
change nobody can review.

## What this line of work may not do

It is **documents only**; the parts the plan describes are later pull requests, each
starting on the owner's go. Nothing under `.github/workflows/` is created or edited (a
workflow that were needed would be proposed under `docs/pending-workflows/` for the owner
to copy). No cloud action of any kind, no secret read or written, and `belong`, EdgeWeb
and EdgeServer are never touched. The strict CSP (`script-src 'self'`, no remote origins)
and the origins gate stay; the JavaScript budget and the 0-byte-JS prose change only
deliberately, with their tests, as the owner's ruling of 2026-10-18 requires.
