# Third-party notices

The Fugaro console ships files that are not ours: the elkjs layout worker; the seven font files of
Instrument Sans and IBM Plex Mono, both under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (their versions and
digests are `src/renderer/fonts/README.md`); and the two runtime dependencies the main process
runs, `electron-updater` 6.8.10 with the fifteen packages of its tree, and `@sentry/electron`
8.2.0 with the fourteen packages of its. Every licence text is in this file, one section each:
elkjs's first, then the two fonts', then the update client's and its tree's, then the crash
reporter's and its tree's.

Both runtime dependencies are packed into the asar's `node_modules` because the main process
requires them at run time -- `dist/main/updater-electron.js` for the update client, and
`dist/main/crash-electron.js` for the crash reporter, which is the one file in the console that
imports it (the owner's rulings D733 and D734 of 2026-10-30) -- and the packages of their trees are packed beside
them. Their sections are the last thirty in this file, and every version in them is the one
`package-lock.json` pins. The last section of all is the one the crash reporter's two server
packages need beside their own: each of them vendors other projects' code, which has no section of
its own because it is not a package of the archive.

**What is no longer in this file, and why.** `@sentry/node` carries `@sentry/bundler-plugins`,
whose job is to wrap *someone else's* webpack, vite, rollup or esbuild build. The console builds
with `npm run build` and bundles nothing at run time, so that subpath and the tree it drags in
(`oxc-parser` and its `@oxc-parser` platform bindings, `@oxc-project/types`, `glob` and
`minimatch`'s family, `magic-string`, `@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec`, `lru-cache`, `minipass`,
`path-scurry`, `dotenv`, and `sentry` 0.45.0) were packed into the asar without anything ever
loading them. `build.files` now excludes each of them by name (Task 2.1b's fix round A) and their
sections are gone with them. The one that is worth a sentence: `sentry` 0.45.0 is under the
**Functional Source License 1.1**, the one licence of that tree that restricts what a licensee may
do with the code rather than only what they must reproduce, and the console neither calls it nor
carries it any more.

**And two that left in fix round B, one of them having arrived without anybody deciding it.** The
packer resolves a dependency edge that no walk of `package-lock.json` can see: the update client's
`debug` does `require('supports-color')` inside a `try`, an optional require rather than a declared
one (the same idiom `debug`'s own source comments on). The packer therefore hoisted
`supports-color` 8.1.1 and its one dependency `has-flag` 4.0.0 **out of the excluded
`@sentry/bundler-plugins` tree** and into the archive's own `node_modules`, so both shipped while
this file -- which reasoned from the lockfile, where the top-level `supports-color` is a
development 7.2.0 -- listed neither. `build.files` now excludes both by name, and the console
still runs: that `require` fails, `debug` catches it and turns colours off, nothing else loads
either package, and the probe below shows the packed app reporting and starting normally without
them. `scripts/check-packed-notices.mjs` is the check that would have
caught this: it packs the app, opens the archive and holds this file to what is inside it.

**The probe.** It is an experiment rather than a script this repository keeps, so it is recorded
here where the two paragraphs above cite it. Run on Linux against `electron-builder --dir` output
(the same target `check-packed-notices.mjs` packs), with the console built by `npm run build`:

- packed **without** the two exclusions, the archive carries `node_modules/supports-color` and
  `node_modules/has-flag`, and the packed console still starts, starts nothing it should not
  (the switch is `null`, so the crash reporter is dormant) and quits normally;
- and nothing in the archive requires either of them: the only `require('supports-color')` in the
  whole tree is `debug`'s, inside a `try`, and no file of the console, of `electron-updater` or of
  `@sentry/electron` names `has-flag`;
- packed **with** the exclusions, the archive's package list is the thirty this file's package
  sections name -- that is what `check:packed` prints, and it is the check that would have caught
  the hoist rather than the probe;
- what loads at run time is what the console's own sources import: `node:` builtins, `electron`,
  `@electron/fuses` (from a file `build.files` excludes), `electron-updater`, and `@sentry/electron`
  from `dist/main/crash-electron.js` -- and, of those, `@sentry/electron` only when the gate opens.
  The excluded trees are reached by none of them, which is why carrying them was a licence question
  rather than a runtime one.

The one thing the probe does *not* say is what the vendored code inside the two Sentry packages
does, and that is the section at the end of this file.

The elkjs worker is `dist/bundle/elk-worker.min.js`, the layout worker of **elkjs 0.11.0**, copied
verbatim by `npm run build` from `node_modules/elkjs/lib/elk-worker.min.js`.

elkjs is licensed under the Eclipse Public License 2.0. Its source is the
`elkjs@0.11.0` package from the npm registry
(https://registry.npmjs.org/elkjs/-/elkjs-0.11.0.tgz), whose repository is
https://github.com/kieler/elkjs.git. The licence text below is copied verbatim from that package's
`LICENSE.md`.

## elkjs 0.11.0 -- Eclipse Public License 2.0

# Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

## 1. DEFINITIONS

“Contribution” means:

-   a\) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
    Distributed under this Agreement, and
-   b\) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    -   i\) changes to the Program, and
    -   ii\) additions to the Program;

    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
    and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
    “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
    behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the
    Program that are not Modified Works.

“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in
any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version
2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or
additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

## 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

-   a\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
    publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
-   b\) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
    under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
    otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
    Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the
    combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
    Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
    Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
    Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
    licensed hereunder.
-   c\) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
    to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program.
-   d\) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.
-   e\) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor
    makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in
    this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program
    under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of
    Section 3).

## 3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

-   a\) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance
    with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a
    statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this
    Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange;
    and
-   b\) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different
    than this Agreement, provided that such license:
    -   i\) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
        warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    -   ii\) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
        liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
        and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    -   iii\) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the
        Source Code under section 3.2; and
    -   iv\) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to
        be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

-   a\) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)
    is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
    available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor
    attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this
    Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of
    such Secondary Licenses, and
-   b\) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
    the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

## 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial
Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.

## 5. NO WARRANTY {#warranty}

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

## 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY {#disclaimer}

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

## Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice {#exhibit-a}

“This Source Code may also be made available under the following
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”

> Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is
> not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
>
> If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
> file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
> file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
> look for such a notice.
>
> You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

## @sentry/electron 8.2.0 -- MIT License

The crash reporter the console's main process starts behind a per-user switch that is off by default
(the owner's rulings D733 and D734 of 2026-10-30), and one of the two runtime dependencies `package.json`
declares. It is packed into the asar's `node_modules` because
`dist/main/crash-electron.js` requires it at run time -- the one file in the console that imports
it -- and the fourteen packages of its tree are packed beside it. Its bundler subpath, and the
build-time tree that subpath carried, are not: the paragraph above names what fix round A took
out and why.

Its source is the `@sentry/electron@8.2.0` package from the npm registry
(https://registry.npmjs.org/@sentry/electron/-/electron-8.2.0.tgz), whose repository is

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## @sentry/server-runtime-injection 11.7.0 -- MIT License

One of the fourteen packages in `@sentry/electron` 8.2.0's tree, pinned in `package-lock.json`
and packed beside it.

Its source is the `@sentry/server-runtime-injection@11.7.0` package from the npm registry
(https://registry.npmjs.org/@sentry/server-runtime-injection/-/server-runtime-injection-11.7.0.tgz), whose repository is
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript.git.

**That package ships no licence file**: its `package.json` declares `"license": "MIT"` and
nothing more, so there is no text to reproduce there.

**And it carries other projects' code besides.** See the section at the end of this file.

## @sentry/server-utils 11.7.0 -- MIT License

One of the fourteen packages in `@sentry/electron` 8.2.0's tree, pinned in `package-lock.json`
and packed beside it.

Its source is the `@sentry/server-utils@11.7.0` package from the npm registry
(https://registry.npmjs.org/@sentry/server-utils/-/server-utils-11.7.0.tgz), whose repository is
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript.git.

**That package ships no licence file**: its `package.json` declares `"license": "MIT"` and
nothing more, so there is no text to reproduce there.

**And it carries other projects' code besides.** See the section at the end of this file.

## The code the Sentry server packages vendor

The three sections above are not only Sentry's code, and the three packages account for what
they carry in three different ways: the two `@sentry/server-*` packages with a licence file
beside it, the one `@sentry/node` with a header inside the source maps of it.

`@sentry/server-utils` and
`@sentry/server-runtime-injection` each carry a `vendored/` directory under `build/cjs/` and
`build/esm/` holding whole copies of other projects' sources, compiled in; the two formats carry
the same projects. **Neither directory names a version, a repository or a licence** -- there is no
`LICENSE` file, no `package.json` to read a `license` field from, and no banner in the files -- so a
reader who opens the archive cannot tell what that code is or what it is under.

**The packages do account for it one level up.** Each ships a `build/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt`
beside the vendored code, and `package.json`'s `files` is `["/build"]`, so that file is inside the
packed app too: an installed copy carries the attribution, not only this file. It names every
vendored project with its version, its licence and its licence text, it is complete (one entry per
vendored project, the two lists agreeing exactly), and **this section is that file's list** -- the
versions and the licence names in the table are its, and the texts below are copied from it
verbatim.

| vendored project | version | licence | vendored by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@apm-js-collab/code-transformer` | 0.18.1 | Apache-2.0 | both |
| `@apm-js-collab/code-transformer-bundler-plugins` | 0.7.4 | MIT declared, no text shipped | `server-utils` |
| `@apm-js-collab/tracing-hooks` | 0.13.3 | Apache-2.0 | `server-runtime-injection` |
| `astring` | 1.9.0 | MIT | both |
| `debug` | 4.4.3 | MIT | `server-runtime-injection` |
| `esquery` | 1.7.0 | BSD-3-Clause | both |
| `has-flag` | 4.0.0 | MIT | `server-runtime-injection` |
| `meriyah` | 6.1.4 | ISC | both |
| `module-details-from-path` | 1.0.4 | MIT | both |
| `ms` | 2.1.3 | MIT | `server-runtime-injection` |
| `semifies` | 1.0.0 | Apache-2.0 | both |
| `source-map` | 0.6.1 | BSD-3-Clause | both |
| `supports-color` | 7.2.0 | MIT | `server-runtime-injection` |

**Three licence texts are not repeated in full here, and each is a reference rather than a gap.**
The console packs `debug` 4.4.3 and `ms` 2.1.3 for `electron-updater` as well, at the same versions
the vendored copies are, and their texts are reproduced in their own sections above. The Apache
License 2.0 is reproduced in full in this file's `## @opentelemetry/api 1.10.0` section:
`semifies` ships exactly that text, and the two `@apm-js-collab` projects ship it with the
appendix's placeholder line filled in, which is the whole of the difference and is reproduced
below. Repeating two hundred lines of the same licence five times would not add a fact.

### @apm-js-collab/code-transformer 0.18.1 and @apm-js-collab/tracing-hooks 0.13.3 (Apache-2.0)

Both mark the appendix's `Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]` line with the holder, and
neither changes another line of the text above. This is the appendix as each ships it, verbatim:

```text
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

   limitations under the License.
```

`@apm-js-collab/code-transformer` -- which is `@apm-js-collab/code-transformer@0.18.1`, whose
`package.json` names `https://github.com/nodejs/orchestrion-js.git` as its repository -- carries
one thing more, the notice its entry ends with:

```text
Notice:
===

Orchestrion-JS
Copyright 2025-Present Datadog, Inc.
This product includes software developed at Datadog (<https://www.datadoghq.com/>).
```

**One entry has nothing to reproduce, and it is the one question this section leaves open.**
`@apm-js-collab/code-transformer-bundler-plugins` is listed with `License: MIT` and then carries no
text at all: the entry has the header fields and no `License Text` under them. Its upstream
repository is public and the declaration is unambiguous, so this is a gap in the shipped file
rather than a licensing doubt -- but the shipped file is what an installed copy has, and it is what
this section can honestly report. **It is flagged for counsel in the pull request**, because it is
a licensing question and not a code decision: no change in this round turns on it.

**A third package of the archive carries vendored files, and its attribution is in its source
maps rather than beside them.** `@sentry/node` -- which the console packs, and which is the crash
reporter's own base package -- has `build/cjs/integrations/fs/vendored/` and its `esm` and
`types` twins, holding three built files (`constants`, `instrumentation`, `utils`) in each
compiled format and a fourth under `types/` (the type-only `types.d.ts`). The emitted `.js` and
`.d.ts` files carry no banner, and the package ships no `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` the way the two
server packages do. What does name them is the `sourcesContent` of the six `.js.map` files beside
the two compiled formats: the first lines of every vendored source are that source's header, and
they are the same six times, which is where the following is read from:

```text
/*
 * Copyright The OpenTelemetry Authors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 *
 * NOTICE from the Sentry authors:
 * - Vendored from: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/tree/15ef7506553f631ea4181391e0c5725a56f0d082/packages/instrumentation-fs
 * - Upstream version: @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fs@0.37.0
 */
```

So the vendored code is `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fs@0.37.0`, an OpenTelemetry Authors
project at upstream version `15ef7506553f631ea4181391e0c5725a56f0d082` of
`opentelemetry-js-contrib`, and its licence is Apache-2.0, whose text is reproduced in full in
this file's `## @opentelemetry/api 1.10.0` section above. The maps are inside the packed app, so
an installed copy carries the attribution too, and the file it sits in is the compiled output's
own source map: the header is a comment in the original TypeScript, and the build strips it from
what it emits. `instrumentation.js.map` carries five further lines after those, the Sentry authors'
list of what they changed on the way in -- TypeScript strictness adjustments, OpenTelemetry's
tracer APIs replaced with Sentry's spans, the upstream `fs_error` span attribute replaced with
the conventions-backed `error.type`. The four `.d.ts.map` files under `types/` carry no
`sourcesContent` at all, so the declarations have nothing beside them; they are the declarations
of these same files, and the attribution above is the one that covers them.
