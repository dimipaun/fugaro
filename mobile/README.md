# `mobile/` — the Fugaro app

The Expo (React Native) app for the phone. It is **its own artifact**: outside
the Go module, with its own release path, and it merges without touching the
CLI (mobile plan D125, Phase 3).

**Status.** Phase 3, task **P3.1** only — the app skeleton and the account
store ([`docs/mobile/implementation-plan.md`](../docs/mobile/implementation-plan.md)
line 455). P3.2 (the feed reader), P3.3 (the job list), P3.4 (the audio
interfaces), P3.5 (the voice screen) and P3.6 (the mailbox client) are not
here. What exists is the shell, the account model, the two device ports and the
fences around them.

## Running the tests

```sh
cd mobile && npm test          # node --test "src/**/*.test.js"
```

Node 22 (`>=22 <23`) and npm 10, per the manifest's `engines`. The script is a
**glob**, deliberately (implementation-plan §"files each task owns"): no later
task has to edit this manifest to add a test file. The cost of a glob is that
`node --test` exits 0 over a pattern that matches nothing, which is the one way
this runner can lie — so `src/skeleton/index.test.js` exists as the red step
that proved the runner was alive before any module was written, and
`src/boundary.test.js` asserts the walk found the app's source before it
trusts what it found.

**No test here needs a device, a network, a database or a microphone** (Global
Constraint 10). That is not an accident of these tests: it is why every module
under `src/` is written as a function of its platform module, with the real
module plugged in by `index.js` at the bottom of the tree.

## The layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.js` | The entry. The one file that knows what a device is: it imports `expo`, `expo-secure-store`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `react` and `react-native`, builds the two ports and the store, and registers the root. No decisions of its own, and no test (see "What is not verified"). |
| `app.json` | The Expo config. No credential, no installation, no bundle identifier, no Android package — see `src/app-config.test.js`. |
| `src/accounts/` | The account store: the installation tuple (`account.js`), the two items (`secret.js`), the secure store (`secure-store.js`), the settings store and its fences (`settings.js`), the per-account listeners and caches (`resources.js`), the store itself (`store.js`), and the two device ports (`expo-secure-store.js`, `expo-async-storage.js`). `index.js` is the one door. |
| `src/app/root.js` | The root shell. Renders the current account's id, and nothing else an installation was built from. |
| `src/boundary.test.js` | The scan that says **which files may write a credential** (below). |
| `src/skeleton/` | The trivial module and test that proved the runner runs (P3.1's red step). |

## Where the phone's secrets live, and what is not stored

D111: an account has **exactly two** items, and both live in **platform secure
storage (Keychain on iOS, Keystore-backed storage on Android) via
`expo-secure-store`**, and nowhere else.

1. **The Firebase Auth ID token** (`idToken`) — the operator identity's
   credential, per account.
2. **The per-pairing MAC key** (`macKey`) — the key D113/P6.3 sign with, per
   account, per pairing.

They are written under `fugaro.account.<accountId>.<item>`, one Keychain item
per account per item, with `keychainAccessible:
WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` (`src/accounts/expo-secure-store.js`). That
choice is the one security decision the port makes, and it has its own test: it
keeps an item out of an **iCloud Keychain backup** and off a **restored-to-
another-phone** device. The MAC key proves possession of the pairing, so a key
that could be restored anywhere would restore the ability to speak as this
installation — `per-pairing` in name only. It is also not readable while the
phone is locked. `requireAuthentication` (a Face ID prompt on every read) is
deliberately **not** set: the ID token is refreshed and read in the background,
and a prompt per refresh is a prompt the owner switches off.

**What is NOT stored, anywhere:**

* **Not in AsyncStorage or any settings file.** D111 says the two items are
  "never in a settings file". The tuple lives in AsyncStorage
  (`src/accounts/expo-async-storage.js`) precisely because that store is
  **unencrypted**; a credential in it would be readable by anyone who can read
  the app's container. Three fences in `settings.js` hold that line: a `Secret`
  cannot be a value (whatever it holds), a credential-*shaped* value is refused
  (JWT, PEM private key, `AIza…` Google key, `sk-…` model key, long hex), and a
  key that names an item or the secure store's namespace is refused.
* **Not logged.** There is no logger in the app: `console.` appears in no
  production file, and a boundary rule below keeps it that way. A `Secret` also
  cannot be printed — `String()`, a template literal, `+`, `JSON.stringify`,
  `util.inspect`, `Object.entries` and a spread all yield `[secret <item>]`,
  and each of those is asserted by name in `secret.test.js`.
* **Not in a fixture, and not in this repository.** Every value in every test
  is synthetic, and the credential-*shaped* strings are assembled at run time
  from harmless pieces (`shared/presence/index.test.js`'s convention), because
  a credential-shaped literal in a repository is a credential-shaped literal in
  every clone, every log and every paste.
* **No shared token store, and no token cache.** D114: an account's items are
  reached by its own id or by nothing. `AccountStore.secret(id, item)` is the
  only call that returns material, it needs the account and the item both, and
  `list()`/`account()` return D114's tuple and no secret.
* **No `belong`.** The `belong` installation is added by the owner by hand
  (D114, Global Constraint 11); no fixture here is recorded from it, and no
  agent touches it. `app.json` ships with no installation in it at all.

## Which files may write a credential

`src/boundary.test.js` is the D54b-clause-(3)-shaped half of P3.1 (reconciliation
§4 tension (b2) clause (4) asks this task for exactly that shape): a scan over
the app's source, four rules, each with an allow-list, a self-exemption and a
**positive control** so a mistyped pattern cannot pass for a clean tree.

| Rule | May appear in | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `…ItemAsync(` (the Keychain SDK) | `src/accounts/expo-secure-store.js` | one module reaches the platform store; a direct SDK call bypasses the port, the `Secret` check and the accessibility |
| `reveal(` | `src/accounts/secret.js`, `src/accounts/secure-store.js` (and tests) | the material is handed to a store in exactly one place; a screen that reveals a token is one refactor from printing it |
| `fugaro.account.` | `src/accounts/secure-store.js`, `src/accounts/settings.js` | a second module that knows the namespace can address an item |
| `console.` | nothing (tests only) | D111's "never logged" is kept by having no logger |

Each rule is mutation-proven — the bug was planted, the run went red, the bug
was removed. The mutations, in the order they were run:

| Mutation | Went red |
| --- | --- |
| `switchTo` opens the next account without checking the teardown | `a teardown that failed does not open the next account` |
| `switchTo` opens before it closes | `switching closes the previous account before it opens the next` |
| `add` drops the duplicate-installation check | `a second entry for one installation is refused, however it is named` |
| `remove` deletes the tuple before forgetting the secrets | `a removal whose secret round fails removes nothing at all` |
| `#read` stops checking the stored id against the key | `a stored tuple this module could not have written fails the whole list` |
| one cache namespace shared by every account | `no read from one account answers with another account's value` |
| the secret key composed without the account id | five secure-store tests, including `there is no shared token store` |
| `SecretStore.put` accepts a bare string | `only a Secret can reach the keychain: a bare string is refused` |
| `Secret.toString`/`toJSON`/`toPrimitive`/`inspect` returns the material | `printing a secret prints the placeholder, in every conversion` |
| the settings store stops refusing a `Secret` value | `a Secret is refused as a value, whatever its shape` |
| the settings key fence stops refusing the item names | the derivation test and two more |
| `items()` probes one of D111's two items instead of the list | three tests, including the derivation one |
| `forget()` forgets one of D111's two items | the derivation test and `forget removes both items of ONE account` |
| the settings word list regains `mac` | `a fence that refused the owner's own installation would be the wrong fence` |
| the Keychain port hardcodes the accessibility instead of reading it from the module | three adapter tests |
| the Keychain port writes without the accessibility option | three adapter tests |
| the port stops refusing a module without the constant | `a module that cannot promise THIS_DEVICE_ONLY is refused outright` |
| the AsyncStorage port calls a method the SDK does not have | `the port translates AsyncStorage's four methods, and renames one` |
| each boundary rule, planted in `src/app/root.js` | its own rule, by name |
| a boundary rule's pattern typo'd to match nothing | the positive control |

Three of those mutations found tests that **could not have failed**: `toString`
was shadowed by `Symbol.toPrimitive`, the settings item-name branch was dead
(both names were already in the word list), and the word list refused
`account.mac`, which is what the owner is likely to call their own machine. All
three were fixed rather than kept — and the same fix was then applied to
`secret.js`'s two names wherever they had been written out again
(`secure-store.js`'s `items()` and `forget()`): the list lives in one place, so
a third item is probed, forgotten and fenced by every module at once instead of
looking exactly like an item the owner never paired.

## What is not verified here

* **The Expo/Metro toolchain.** It is not installed in the environment this was
  written in, and nothing under `mobile/` declares a runtime dependency yet —
  which is asserted, so the manifest cannot quietly grow one. There has been no
  `expo start`, no `expo lint`, no `eas build` and no device or simulator run.
  `package.json`'s `test` script is the whole of the verified surface.
* **The SDKs themselves.** `expo`, `expo-secure-store`,
  `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `react` and `react-native` are
  faked in every test that touches them: what is tested is the shape of the
  calls this repository makes (including the accessibility constant, read off
  the module rather than guessed), not what the modules do. `index.js`, which
  imports the real ones, is untested for that reason.
* **`WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`'s name and value**, which come from the
  documented `expo-secure-store` API and are not exercised against the package.
  The port refuses to construct if the constant is missing, so an SDK rename is
  a loud failure rather than a silent downgrade to the platform default — but
  the constant has not been seen on a device here.
* **The release path and the checks that need a device.** Checks **80–89** are
  owner-run; **87** (multi-account switching with no cross-leakage) needs two
  real installations, one of them `belong`, and **89** is the store identity.
  The isolation is asserted here as a property over fakes — two accounts, no
  read answers with the other's value, no listener survives a switch — and that
  is a statement about this code, not about a phone. No iOS bundle identifier or
  Android package is committed: those are the owner's, and they differ per
  installation (D125).
