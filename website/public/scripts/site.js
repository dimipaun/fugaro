/* website/public/scripts/site.js — the site's one script (decision D183, redesign part P6).
 *
 * The site ships exactly one first-party script file and this is it: one request, one line
 * in the byte budget, one file to read. `website/test/budget.mjs` counts these bytes as
 * every page's JavaScript, `website/test/copy.mjs` holds the controls it drives to the
 * markup they are written in, and `website/test/origins.mjs` reads the file for any origin
 * that is not this one — of which there are none: it fetches nothing, and it names no URL.
 *
 * What it does:
 *
 *   - **The copy control on every command block (part P6).** The markup renders each block
 *     with its control already in it and `hidden`, and this reveals the control and drives
 *     it. A browser that runs no script therefore shows the command and no button, rather
 *     than a button that copies nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here is load-bearing: the commands are in the markup in full, and every one of
 * them is readable, selectable and copyable by hand without this file ever arriving.
 *
 * It is loaded with `defer` from the base layout, so it runs once the document has been
 * parsed and every block it looks for is in the tree. It writes no storage and sets no
 * cookie: the clipboard it writes to is the reader's own.
